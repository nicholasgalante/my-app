# My Journal 

This is a React application that allows users to create journal entries and search through previous entries. The app is designed to provide an easy and user-friendly interface to help users keep track of their thoughts and memories.

## Features
***
* Create a journal entry with a title and text content 
* Search and filter through previous entries
* Follow custom URL to access specific entries
* Delete journal entries


## React Concepts Used
***
* Components: The app is built using a combination of functional and class-based components to create a reusable and modular structure.
* State: The state of the app is managed using React state to store the current journal entries and search query.
* Props: Props are used to pass data between components, allowing for a flexible and scalable architecture.
* Event Handlers: Event handlers are used to handle user interactions with the app, such as submitting a new journal entry or searching through previous entries.
* Route, Switch, and NavLink from react-router: These are used to provide a dynamic and flexible routing system for the application, allowing for multiple pages and navigation between different sections of the app.


## Vanilla Javascript Concepts Used
***
* Fetch requests (post, patch, and delete): These are used to interact with an API, allowing the app to retrieve, update, and delete data stored on a server. Currently, this data is saved to a JSON file stored in the repository.
* Filter: The filter method is used to filter an array of data based on certain criteria, such as searching for journal entries that match a certain title.
* Map: The map method is used to transform an array of data into a new array, such as transforming an array of journal entries into an array of formatted HTML elements.

## How to run the app
***
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/nicholasgalante/my-app.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the React development server: `npm start`


## Conclusion
***
This journal app is a simple application that demonstrates the core concepts of React. By using components, state, props, and event handlers, the app provides a solid foundation for building more complex React applications.
